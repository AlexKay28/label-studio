## Create organizations to manage data and projects

You can create organizations in Label Studio to correspond to different departments in your company, for example to delineate between completely unrelated departments. If some departments might collaborate with each other on a project, set up an organization for both and use workspaces to organize the projects that they might or might not be collaborating on. 

For example, you can set up one of the following possible configurations:
- One organization for your company, with one workspace for the support department and another for the development team, with specific projects in each workspace for different types of customer requests. 
- Multiple organizations, such as one for the customer claims department and another for the customer support department, with specific workspaces in each organization for specific types of insurance, such as home insurance claims and auto insurance claims, and specific projects in each workspace for types of claims, such as Accident Claims, Injury Claims, Natural Disaster Claims. The Customer support organization might have workspaces specific to the types of support queues, with projects for specific types of calls received.  

Users within an organization can see all workspaces, even if they don't have access to them. Use organizations to prevent some users from knowing about the existence of other workspaces and projects.
