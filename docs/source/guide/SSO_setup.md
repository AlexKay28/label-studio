> Beta documentation: Label Studio Enterprise v2.0.0 is currently in Beta. As a result, this documentation might not reflect the current functionality of the product.

Set up single sign-on using SAML to manage access to Label Studio using your existing Identity Provider (IdP). 

> SSO is only available in Label Studio Enterprise Edition. If you're using Label Studio Community Edition, see [Features of Label Studio](label_studio_compare.html) to learn more.

The organization owner for Label Studio can set up SSO & SAML for the Label Studio instance. Label Studio Enterprise supports the following IdPs:
- Microsoft Active Directory
- OneLogin
- others that use SAML assertions

## Set up SAML SSO
Set up SAML SSO with Label Studio Enterprise. After you set up SSO, you can no longer use native authentication to access the Label Studio UI unless you have the Owner role.
