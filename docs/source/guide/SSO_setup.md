Set up single sign-on using SAML to manage access to Label Studio using your existing Identity Provider (IdP). 

Only Label Studio Enterprise Edition supports SSO. 

The organization owner for Label Studio can set up SSO & SAML for the Label Studio instance. Label Studio Enterprise supports the following IdPs:
- Microsoft Active Directory
- OneLogin
- others that use SAML assertions

## Set up SAML SSO
Set up SAML SSO with Label Studio Enterprise. After you set up SSO, you can no longer use native authentication to access the Label Studio UI unless you have the Owner role.
